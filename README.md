# Lets Get These Groceries
Generate a Grocery list based on the JSON file and display with the corresponding svg icon

## Design Decisions
* used light minimal colors since the page relates to food
* used svg icons from the noun project
* created a list view and category view since people organize lists differently
* kept the default styles for the radio buttons and checkbox inputs

## Accessibility
* added descriptive alt tags to all the images used
* used the default styles for inputs to make sure the page could be navigated using the keyboard alone
* checked the page using the safari screen reader
